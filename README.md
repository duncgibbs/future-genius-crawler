# future-genius-crawler
A web crawler for assigning random quotes to random Future lyrics. My goal is to get one accepted on Rap Genius.

For a more detailed explanation, I made a presentation:
[Future Rap Genius Web Crawler](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z2dhwaYPR7jsQ-vQa85bGhSVTeQ_hCoRB2aX-KpDFDg/pub?start=false&loop=true&delayms=30000)

See the results at: [FutureGeniusQuotes Profile Page](https://genius.com/FutureGeniusQuotes)

Goal: 

Get random movie-quote-based annotations upvoted on Rap Genius as "valid analysis."

Dream:

[Future himself](https://genius.com/artists/Future) is a registered member of Rap Genius. He has the ability the verify annotations. This is equivalent to him saying "Yeah, that's what I meant."

There would be no higher honor for my program than to have an annotation verified.

------

Methodology:

I have built a web crawler that:

1) Will grab a random line from a random Future song.

2) Will look up words from that line, and pick a random quote, from the IMDB quote database.

3) Will annotate the lyric with the random quote and submit it as an interpretation of the song.
